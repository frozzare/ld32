This is the game I created during ld32. The game is to survive as long as possible. Control with the arrow keys and shoot with the spacebar. Watch out for those red circles, yellow circles give more points.

Tested with Haxe 3.1.3

# Install

```
  haxelib install haxepunk
  haxelib install lime

```
